# Learning-JAVA

I started learning JAVA and its Object-oriented concepts from the Massive Open Online Courses(MOOC), offered by University of Helsinki's Department of Computer Science.

I found the course perfect, clean and organised so that even beginners with no programming knowledge can start with it.
So, I choose this course.
# What is this Repository about?
In the course after learning the concept, we are provided with with some programs to test our understanding. This repository includes all solutions for those progrmas written by me.
# More about the course
The cousrse Java Programming is divided into two parts:
- Java Programming - 1
- Java Programming - 2

Each having 7 parts.

## Java Programming - 1
- **Part 1:** Getting started with programming, Printing, Reading input, Variables, Calculating with numbers, Conditional statements and conditional operation, Programming in our society
- **Part 2:** Recurring problems and patterns to solve them, Repeating functionality, More loops, Methods and dividing the program into smaller parts
- **Part 3:** Discovering errors, Lists, Arrays, Using Strings
- **Part 4:** Introduction to object-oriented programming, Objects in a lists, Files and reading data
- **Part 5:** Learning object-oriented programming, Removing repetitive code, Primitive and reference variables, Objects and references
- **Part 6:** Objects on a list and a list as part of an object, Separating the user interface from program logic, Introduction to testing
- **Part 7:** Programming paradigms, Algorithms, Larger programming exercises

## Java Programming - 2
- **Part 8:** Short recap(Java Programming - 1), Hash Map, Similarity of objects, Grouping data using hash maps, Fast data fetching and grouping information
- **Part 9:** . Class inheritance, Interfaces, Object polymorphism
- **Part 10:** Handling collections as streams, The Comparable Interface, Other useful techniques
- **Part 11:** Class diagrams, Packages, Exceptions, Processing files
